# Future Prospects - Graded Unit 2 Project

Year two graded unit project created for HND Software Development at City of Glasgow College. The site is a college admissions site, developed using Ruby on Rails. Students sign up for accounts, apply for courses, and accept/decline offers.

Web Address: https://futureprospects.herokuapp.com/

Note: the web site sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity, so can take a few seconds to warm up.
