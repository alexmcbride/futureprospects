# Graded Unit 2 Project

*Project Brief*

A group of colleges has asked for a system to create and track applications for their respective courses.

Colleges would log on to upload or update their sections with their courses, entry requirements, and availability and be able to view all applications to the selected courses and update their statuses to Conditional, Unconditional or Declined.

Students will be allowed to create a log in and then browse the list of courses on offer from the colleges via a main view page which would include a detailed search function. Students may apply up to a maximum of 5 different courses and be charged accordingly per course. Payment can be made by credit/debit card or by Paypal. When the Student applies to a course they will be able to track their application via their log in and respond to any updates placed on their application such as Accepting or Rejecting the offer. Only one log in is allowed per student and the application process would include proof of ID and qualifications.

The system should also include a Clearance Section which will only operate in the period of time between school results being released and the start of College term. This section would include an area where all courses which still contain spaces are displayed and the college contact details are provided for students to call and arrange their place.
