      <p>This page lets you keep track of your courses and what decisions have been made on them. All of your selected
      colleges have made their decisions and you can view them below. A decision may be accompanied by a note, either
      explaining why a decision was taken, or what your next steps should be. Once ready, select the option to make
      your choices to move to the next stage.</p>

      <h2 class="no-top-margin">College Decisions</h2>
      <p>This page lets you keep track of your courses and what decisions have been made on them. Each course will be
      considered by the respective college and once a decision has been made you will be notified. Once all decisions
      have been received you can then proceed to prioritise your offers, so you can pick the course or college that's
      right for you.</p>
