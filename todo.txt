guard against loading application methods (remove course etc.) after application has been submitted.

when student makes change to associative-model page (e.g. education) then automatically mark stage as incomplete?

improve layout of add course autocomplete

switch navbar bg colour for staff members?

markdown preview?

apply for course

when change status, do the right thing... e.g. if cancelled, email students.

staff members need their own nav menu, it's too confusing otherwise.

look to reducing amount of stuff selected from DB, for instance display all colleges list, only need college name and id, not everything...

application stages not links until stage marked as complete

add city field to addresses...

applications, move optional label to top on all pages (currently just profile)
